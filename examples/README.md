# Examples
The majority of the examples are located within the `freertos` directory. This directory is organised to facilitate the exploration and testing of specific features within the FreeRTOS architecture for the data logger project. Each subdirectory focuses on testing distinct features, with examples building upon one another to form the foundation for the data logger. This structure approach makes it easy to reference and incorporate into the final firmware implementation.
Each example within the `freertos` directory is designed for independent compilation and uploading onto the Raspberry Pico W. Some may contain python host script to interact with the Pico W.
